												<h4>ETL Exercise</h4>
												<p>The ReDO program will extract and transform the data located in the ETLLegacyDBData text file and the ETLManualData 
												csv file. The transforming process standardizes all formats and organizes the data into designed columns. 
												There is an error log that is also exported once the transforming process is completed in order to log all changes 
												that were made. The transform process also involves combining data from both files into one for a more convenient upload.
												Once upload to MySQL database has been completed, the ETLWEB.php code displays data online using Google Charts.</p>

											<div class="inner">
												<h4>ToDoList Exercise</h4>
												<p>Using Android Studio this app allows the user to make a to do list for 
												   the day. The app uploads the task to a firebase realtime database and stores all tasks 
												   created. The app had to be uploaded to github via zip file due to its size.</p>

											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Linked List with Dates</h4>
												<p>The date database program allows the option of uploading a txt file with dates 
												   already written out, manually entering the desired dates, or randomly creating and
												   entering as many dates as desired. The dates are entered into database and connected
												   using a linked list. Once the dates are in the database, there are options of deleting,
												   adding, modifying, or searching through the stored dates.</p>

												<h4>Linked List with Dates</h4>
												<p>This is a word document presentation using R-Studio to statistically analyze 
												   starting income and house prices in California and Tennessee to determine the ability 
												   to own a home. In the presentation box plots and t-tests are used to develop 
												   hypothesis and findings.</p>
